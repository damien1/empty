#What is empty?
Welcome - empty is a bunch of tasks for WordPress plugin developers that help automate the build thanks to Apache Ant.

##Why ANT not PHING?
Go ask Google that ... there are plenty of conversations elsewhere on ANT vs PHING. It's really a personal choice.

I'm not a Java Developer .. but I'm using Jenkins CI and I also use Mac, Windows & *nix so ANT was preferred

##Why not Grunt.js?
Well yes, experimentation is good ... Grunt.js may fit in there somewhere if ANT tasks for minify aren't simple

Have fun!
